Branches are used to allow multiple developers to work on the same project at
once.  Branches allow developers to work on exploratory changes to their code
while leaving the main "working" code unchanged with little risk.

I. Inheritance: when a class inherits behaviors or attributes from a parent
class it extends.
II. Polymorphism: when one class can be treated as another class (e.g., A
`Truck` or `Bus` that is treated as a `Car`) without special consideration by
the programmer of a particular piece of code.
III. Encapsulation: when the internal bookkeeping or details of how a class
works are hidden from users of the class.

With the director/lieutenant models there are multiple people handling conflict
resolution and merge issues. With the integration manager workflow, only the
integration manager is pulling changes from each developer's personal repository.

A team of 100s of developers would benefit from the dictator/lieutenant model
because each lieutenant could handle a separate subsystem of the overall project
and make integration easier for the dictator that controls the "blessed"
repository. This example is actually what the Linux kernel uses, with Linus
Torvalds (the kernel's original author) being the BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for
Life) of the kernel code.
