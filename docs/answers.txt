I. Inheritance: when a class inherits behaviors or attributes from a parent
class it extends.
II. Polymorphism: when one class can be treated as another class (e.g., A
`Truck` or `Bus` that is treated as a `Car`) without special consideration by
the programmer of a particular piece of code.
III. Encapsulation: when the internal bookkeeping or details of how a class
works are hidden from users of the class.
